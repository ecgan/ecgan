# Hi there, I'm Gan 👋

I'm a software engineer passionate about building scalable and efficient software solutions. Based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, I have been doing full-stack web development since 2008 with strong interest in front-end UI development using React, TypeScript, JavaScript etc.

I work remotely with global companies around the world. I have previously worked with Automattic, WooCommerce, Fast.co, Experian etc. I love open source and I have contributed to projects like WordPress and WooCommerce.

When I am not coding, I enjoy good food (ask me about coffee and durian) and good movies (Christopher Nolan's fan here).
