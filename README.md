# Hi there, I'm Gan 👋

I'm a software engineer passionate about building scalable and efficient software solutions with delightful user experience. Based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, I have been doing full-stack web development since 2008 with strong interest in front-end UI development using React, TypeScript, JavaScript etc.

I work remotely with global companies around the world. I have previously worked with Automattic, WooCommerce, Fast.co, Experian etc. I love open source and I have contributed to projects like WordPress and WooCommerce.

I am also a public speaker. I gave some talks about remote working culture and WordPress. The recordings are available at [WordPress.tv](https://wordpress.tv/speakers/gan-eng-chin/).

When I am not coding, I enjoy good food (ask me about coffee and durian) and good movies (big Christopher Nolan's fan here).
